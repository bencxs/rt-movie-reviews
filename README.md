Sentiment analysis on Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews

## Introduction
Practice code implementing a Convolutional Neural Network to classify positive vs negative movie reviews taken from Rotten Tomatoes.

## Requirements
Libraries used:
* Python (2.7)
* TensorFlow (> 0.10)
* TFLearn

Also, the pretrained word2vec weights binary file can be downloaded from

https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/

## Status
* Base model implemented using TFLearn, a high-level API for TensorFlow to allow quick and easy prototyping.
* Native TensorFlow code implemented.
* Added pretrained word2vec weights.
